# CatBurglar 

## Installation

### For developers

#### 1. Set up a virtual environment

Create your virtual environment in your preferred manner. Then, with the envrionment active, run the following from the 
root of the project:

    pip install -e .

#### 2. Set up your development environment for debugging
If you use a debugger in an IDE, you may need to alter the path that is set as the working directory when debugging from
`main.py`. On pycharm, this may be found under  `Run > Edit Configurations`.
You will need to set the run configuration for main.py to the root of the directory so that it can find assets
when run from the IDE ui.
